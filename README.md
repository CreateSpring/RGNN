# RGNN

This repo illustrates the RGNN model implementation in the paper *EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Using Regularized Graph Neural Networks*. The model is based on [torch geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric) v1.2.1

The EmotionDL regularizer is easy to implement and thus not included in the repo. More details can be found in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07835).
